## Abstract
The Software Engineering (SWE) Bench is a crucial benchmark for evaluating methods in software engineering problem-solving. Current open-source approaches, such as agent- less solutions, SWE agents, AutoCoderOver, SWE Search, and
OpenHands, have limitations in efficiency, cost, and accuracy. This research proposes a novel methodology that balances cost- effectiveness with high SWE Bench scores. Our approach in- tegrates an iterative reasoning process, mimicking the learning process of software engineers, and employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework leveraging Stack Overflow datasets. We introduce a graph-based repository representation to reduce the search space and improve retrieval accuracy by establishing structured connections between files. Additionally, we incorporate deep Large Language Model (LLM) thinking strategies, inspired by Googleâ€™s Mind Evolution research, to learn from the wrong patches through iterative recombination and refinement. Our proposed method aims to achieve higher SWE Bench scores while maintaining a cost-effective and practical approach for real-world software development
